# WhatsApp Agent

The application lives in the `agentic/` directory. It is a Next.js project that exposes a Twilio-compatible webhook for WhatsApp and includes a web playground for testing responses before going live.

Quick start:

```bash
cd agentic
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to explore setup instructions and the simulator. Full documentation is in `agentic/README.md`.
